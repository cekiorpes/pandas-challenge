### **Heroes of Pymoli**

Using pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze purchase data for Heroes of Pymoli, a free-to-play game with the option to buy certain items in game. 

The data analysis calculates total number of players, gender and age demographics, and purchasing trends for each demographic. It also analyzes which players spend the most on in-game purchases as well as which items are the most popular and which are the most profitable. 


#### **Observations based on the data analysis**

Heroes of Pymoli players are largely male and spend the most money as a group, but the female and other/non-disclosed gender players spend more money on average when playing.

The game is most popular with players age 15-30, with players aged 20-24 comprising the largest group. Most of the revenue comes from these groups, but players aged 35-39 have the highest average total purchase per person. 

The Final Critic and Oathbreaker items are the most popular as well as the most profitable items. None of the 5 items with the highest individual price were in the top 5 most popular or most profitable.
